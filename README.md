# 7400-logisim
Logisim library of 7400-series ICs

All circuits are intended for good 'ol Logisim 2.7.1.
Should also work with Logisim-ITA.
Don't know about Evolution which seems to constantly break older circuits,
which is the reason I keep using the original version which, despite some of its UI related bugs, is a fixed target.
New circuits are added on a need-to-have basis.
Have fun!
